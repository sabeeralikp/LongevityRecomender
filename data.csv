can extend your life"
10,Is walking better than running?,Walking can provide a lot of the same benefits of running. But running burns nearly double the number of calories as walking.
11,Benefits vs. risks,"Running is a great way to get in shape and lose weight. But it’s a high-impact exercise. High-impact workouts can be harder on your body than low-impact exercises like walking.

Over time, running may lead to common overuse injuries such as:

stress fractures
shin splints
ITB friction syndrome"
12,How Running Helps You Lose Weight,"Running is an incredibly popular way to exercise.

Running is also linked to many health benefits, and is one of the best types of exercise to help you lose weight"
13,There Are Many Types of Running,"There are many types of runs, each with their own purpose and benefits. Normal runs are considered base runs."
14,It Burns More Calories Than Most Exercises,Running is an excellent choice of exercise for weight loss because it burns more calories than many alternatives.
15,High-Intensity Running Continues to Burn Calories After Exercise,"High-intensity running like sprints, intervals and hill runs can continue to burn calories long after a workout due to the “afterburn effect.”"
16,High-Intensity Running Suppresses Appetite and Helps You Eat Less,Running may help you lose weight by lowering the production of hunger hormones and increasing the production of satiety hormones.
17,Moderate-to-High Intensity Running Targets Harmful Belly Fat,"Many studies have found that moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise like running targets harmful belly fat, even without dietary changes."
18,Running Has Many Other Benefits for Health,"Along with weight loss, running can provide various health benefits, including a lower risk of heart disease, reduced blood sugar, lower cataracts risk, lower falls risk, stronger knees and less knee pain."
19,Sample Running Plan,"Running is easy to begin and requires minimal equipment. A beginner should aim to run for 30 minutes 3 or 4 days a week, including 5 minutes of warming up and cooling down."
20,Regular Exercise Can Make You Feel Happier,"A beginner’s running plan should alternate between running and walking. As you progress, increase the time spent running weekly or decrease the time spent walking between runs."
21,Regular Exercise Can Help With Weight Loss,Changing your workouts often or running with a friend can make your routine fun and help you to stay motivated long-term.
22,Regular Exercise Is Good for Your Muscles and Bones,Exercising regularly can improve your mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression.

29,Regular Exercise Can Promote a Better Sex Life,"Regular physical activity, regardless of whether it is aerobic or a combination of aerobic and resistance training, can help you sleep better and feel more energized during the day."
30,What is cardio yoga?,Exercise has favorable effects on the pain that’s associated with various conditions. It can also increase pain tolerance.
31,Weight loss,"Exercise can help improve sexual desire, function and performance in men and women. It can also help decrease the risk of erectile dysfunction in men."
32,Comparison with other cardio exercises,"Unlike traditional yoga, which focuses on breathing techniques, body flow, and postures, cardio yoga incorporates more dynamic movements that ramp up the intensity and elevate your heart rate."
33,Calories burned hiking,Performing cardio yoga can ramp up calorie burning and aid weight loss in combination with a low calorie diet.
34,Hiking vs. walking and running,More intense versions of yoga like cardio yoga burn a similar number of calories as exercising on an elliptical at a moderate effort but fewer calories than jogging.
35,Benefits of hiking,The total calories you burn hiking depends mainly on your weight and the trail grade. Choosing a trail with a higher grade increases the number of calories burned per hour.
36,Cut back on refined carbs,"The number of calories burned walking or running depends on your body weight and speed. In general, hiking burns fewer calories than running but more than walking."
37,"Eat protein, fat, and vegetables","Hiking may aid weight loss by increasing the number of calories you burn. Compared with indoor exercise, it’s associated with greater improvements in mental health."
38,Move your body,"Reducing sugars and starches, or carbs, from your diet can help curb your appetite, lower your insulin levels, and make you lose weight.

But the long-term effects of a low carb diet are not yet known. A reduced calorie diet could be more sustainable."
39,What about calories and portion control?,"Assemble each meal out of a protein source, healthy fat source, complex carb, and vegetables.

Leafy green vegetables are a great way to bulk up a meal with low calories and lots of nutrients."
40,weight loss tips,"Resistance training, such as weightlifting, is a great option for losing weight. If that’s not possible, cardio workouts are also effective.

Choose what’s sustainable for you."
41,How fast will you lose weight?,"Counting calories isn’t usually needed to lose weight on a low carb eating plan. But if you’re not losing weight or on a reduced calorie eating plan, calorie counting may help.

"
42,"Drink Water, Especially Before Meals","Eating whole foods, higher protein, soluble fiber, and less sugar can help you lose more weight. Don’t forget to get a good night’s sleep, too."
43,Eat Eggs For Breakfast,"Significant weight can be lost on a low carb or low calorie diet, but the speed depends on the individual.

General weight loss can improve certain markers of health, such as blood sugar and cholesterol levels."
44,Drink Coffee (Preferably Black),"It is often claimed that drinking water can help with weight loss — and that’s true.

Drinking water can boost metabolism by 24–30% over a period of 1–1.5 hours, helping you burn off a few more calories"
45,Drink Green Tea,"Eating whole eggs can have all sorts of benefits, including helping you lose weight."
46,Try Intermittent Fasting,Coffee has been unfairly demonized. Quality coffee is loaded with antioxidants and can have numerous health benefits.
47,Take a Glucomannan Supplement,"Like coffee, green tea also has many benefits, one of them being weight loss.

Though green tea contains small amounts of caffeine, it is loaded with powerful antioxidants called catechins, which are believed to work synergistically with caffeine to enhance fat burning "
48,Cut Back on Added Sugar,Intermittent fasting is a popular eating pattern in which people cycle between periods of fasting and eating.
49,Eat Less Refined Carbs,"A fiber called glucomannan has been linked to weight loss in several studies.

This type of fiber absorbs water and sits in your gut for a while, making you feel more full and helping you eat fewer calories"
50,Go on a Low-Carb Diet,Added sugar is one of the worst ingredients in the modern diet. Most people consume way too much.
51,Use Smaller Plates,"Refined carbohydrates include sugar and grains that have been stripped of their fibrous, nutritious parts. These include white bread and pasta."
52,Exercise Portion Control or Count Calories,"If you want to get all the benefits of carb restriction, then consider going all the way and committing to a low-carb diet."
53,Keep Healthy Food Around in Case You Get Hungry,Using smaller plates has been shown to help some people automatically eat fewer calories
54,Take Probiotic Supplements,"Portion control — simply eating less — or counting calories can be very useful, for obvious reasons"
55,Eat Spicy Foods,"Keeping healthy food nearby can help prevent you from eating something unhealthy if you become excessively hungry.

Snacks that are easily portable and simple to prepare include whole fruits, nuts, baby carrots, yogurt and hard-boiled eggs."
56,Do Aerobic Exercise,"Taking probiotic supplements containing bacteria of the Lactobacillus subfamily have been shown to reduce fat mass .

However, the same doesn’t apply to all Lactobacillus species. Some studies have linked L. acidophilus with weight gain"

58,Eat More Fiber,Doing aerobic exercise (cardio) is an excellent way to burn calories and improve your physical and mental health.
59,Eat More Vegetables and Fruits,"One of the worst side effects of dieting is that it tends to cause muscle loss and metabolic slowdown, often referred to as starvation mode"
60,Get Good Sleep,"Fiber is often recommended for weight loss.

Although the evidence is mixed, some studies show that fiber (especially viscous fiber) can increase satiety and help you control your weight over the long term"
61,Beat Your Food Addiction,"Vegetables and fruits have several properties that make them effective for weight loss.

They contain few calories but a lot of fiber. Their high water content gives them low energy density, making them very filling."
62,Eat More Protein,Sleep is highly underrated but may be just as important as eating healthy and exercising.
63,Supplement With Whey Protein,"A recent study found that 19.9% of people in North America and Europe fulfill the criteria for food addiction 

If you experience overpowering cravings and can’t seem to curb your eating no matter how hard you try, you may suffer from addiction."
64,"Don’t Do Sugary Drinks, Including Soda and Fruit Juice","Protein is the single most important nutrient for losing weight.

Eating a high-protein diet has been shown to boost metabolism by 80–100 calories per day while shaving 441 calories per day off your diet"
65,"Eat Whole, Single-Ingredient Foods (Real Food)","If you struggle to get enough protein in your diet, taking a supplement — such as protein powder — can help."
66,Don’t Diet — Eat Healthy Instead,"Sugar is bad, but sugar in liquid form is even worse. Studies show that calories from liquid sugar may be the single most fattening aspect of the modern diet"
67,Chew More Slowly,"If you want to be a leaner, healthier person, then one of the best things you can do for yourself is to eat whole, single-ingredient foods.

These foods are naturally filling, and it’s very difficult to gain weight if the majority of your diet is based on them."
68,How weight loss occurs,"One of the biggest problems with diets is that they rarely work in the long term.

If anything, people who diet tend to gain more weight over time, and studies show that dieting is a consistent predictor of future weight gain"
69,Best diet for weight loss,Your brain may take a while to register that you’ve had enough to eat. Some studies show that chewing more slowly can help you eat fewer calories and increase the production of hormones linked to weight loss
70,Safe rates of weight loss,Weight loss occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn each day.
71,Add Protein to Your Diet,"Adhering to a weight loss diet is difficult for most people. Regardless of your goals, choose a dietary pattern based on your individual preferences and health status."
72,"Eat Whole, Single-Ingredient Foods","Losing weight too quickly can lead to problems like gallstones, muscle loss, and extreme fatigue. Experts recommend a moderate weight loss of 1–3 pounds (0.45–1.36 kg) per week, or about 1% of your body weight."
73,Avoid Processed Foods,"When it comes to weight loss, protein is the king of nutrients.

Your body burns calories when digesting and metabolizing the protein you eat, so a high-protein diet can boost metabolism by up to 80–100 calories per day"
74,Stock Up on Healthy Foods and Snacks,"One of the best things you can do to become healthier is to base your diet on whole, single-ingredient foods"
75,Limit Your Intake of Added Sugar,"Processed foods are usually high in added sugars, added fats and calories.

What’s more, processed foods are engineered to make you eat as much as possible. They are much more likely to cause addictive-like eating than unprocessed foods"
76,Drink Water,"Studies have shown that the food you keep at home greatly affects weight and eating behavior

By always having healthy food available, you reduce the chances of you or other family members eating unhealthy."
77,Drink (Unsweetened) Coffee,"Eating a lot of added sugar is linked with some of the world’s leading diseases, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and cancer (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source).

On average, Americans eat about 15 teaspoons of added sugar each day. This amount is usually hidden in various processed foods, so you may be consuming a lot of sugar without even realizing it "
78,Supplement With Glucomannan,"There is actually truth to the claim that drinking water can help with weight loss.

Drinking 0.5 liters (17 oz) of water may increase the calories you burn by 24–30% for an hour afterward (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).

Drinking water before meals may also lead to reduced calorie intake, especially for middle-aged and older people (20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source).

Water is particularly good for weight loss when it replaces other beverages that are high in calories and sugar"
79,Avoid Liquid Calories,"Fortunately, people are realizing that coffee is a healthy beverage that is loaded with antioxidants and other beneficial compounds.

Coffee drinking may support weight loss by increasing energy levels and the amount of calories you burn"
80,Limit Your Intake of Refined Carbs,"Glucomannan is one of several weight loss pills that has been proven to work.

This water-soluble, natural dietary fiber comes from the roots of the konjac plant, also known as the elephant yam."
81,Fast Intermittently,"Liquid calories come from beverages like sugary soft drinks, fruit juices, chocolate milk and energy drinks.

These drinks are bad for health in several ways, including an increased risk of obesity. One study showed a drastic 60% increase in the risk of obesity among children, for each daily serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage"
82,Drink (Unsweetened) Green Tea,"Refined carbs are carbs that have had most of their beneficial nutrients and fiber removed.

The refining process leaves nothing but easily digested carbs, which can increase the risk of overeating and disease"
83,Eat More Fruits and Vegetables,"Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

There are a few different ways to do intermittent fasting, including the 5:2 diet, the 16:8 method and the eat-stop-eat method."
84,Count Calories Once in a While,"Green tea is a natural beverage that is loaded with antioxidants.

Drinking green tea is linked with many benefits, such as increased fat burning and weight loss"
85,Try a Low-Carb Diet,"Fruits and vegetables are extremely healthy, weight-loss-friendly foods.

In addition to being high in water, nutrients and fiber, they usually have very low energy density. This makes it possible to eat large servings without consuming too many calories."
86,Eat More Slowly,"Being aware of what you’re eating is very helpful when trying to lose weight.

There are several effective ways to do this, including counting calories, keeping a food diary or taking pictures of what you eat"
87,Replace Some Fat with Coconut Oil,"Some studies have shown that using smaller plates helps you eat less, because it changes how you see portion sizes .

People seem to fill their plates the same, regardless of plate size, so they end up putting more food on larger plates than smaller ones"
88,Add Eggs to Your Diet,"Many studies have shown that low-carb diets are very effective for weight loss.

Limiting carbs and eating more fat and protein reduces your appetite and helps you eat fewer calories 

This can result in weight loss that is up to 3 times greater than that from a standard low-fat diet 

A low-carb diet can also improve many risk factors for disease."
89,Spice Up Your Meals,"If you eat too fast, you may eat way too many calories before your body even realizes that you are full

Faster eaters are much more likely to become obese, compared to those who eat more slowly"
90,Take Probiotics,"Coconut oil is high in fats called medium-chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats."
91,Get Enough Sleep,"Eggs are the ultimate weight loss food. They are cheap, low in calories, high in protein and loaded with all sorts of nutrients.

High-protein foods have been shown to reduce appetite and increase fullness, compared to foods that contain less protein"
92,Brush Your Teeth After Meals,"Chili peppers and jalapenos contain a compound called capsaicin, which may boost metabolism and increase the burning of fat .

Capsaicin may also reduce appetite and calorie intake"
93,Combat Your Food Addiction.,"Probiotics are live bacteria that have health benefits when eaten. They can improve digestive health and heart health, and may even help with with weight loss"
94,Do Some Sort of Cardio,"Getting enough sleep is incredibly important for weight loss, as well as to prevent future weight gain."
95,Add Resistance Exercises,"Fiber-rich foods may help with weight loss.

Foods that contain water-soluble fiber may be especially helpful, since this type of fiber can help increase the feeling of fullness.

Fiber may delay stomach emptying, make the stomach expand and promote the release of satiety hormones"
96,Use Whey Protein,"Many people brush or floss their teeth after eating, which may help limit the desire to snack or eat between meals (99Trusted Source).

This is because many people do not feel like eating after brushing their teeth. Plus, it can make food taste bad."
97,Practice Mindful Eating,Food addiction involves overpowering cravings and changes in your brain chemistry that make it harder to resist eating certain foods
98,Focus on Changing Your Lifestyle,"Doing cardio — whether it is jogging, running, cycling, power walking or hiking — is a great way to burn calories and improve both mental and physical health.

Cardio has been shown to improve many risk factors for heart disease. It can also help reduce body weight"
99,What is BMI?,"Loss of muscle mass is a common side effect of dieting.

If you lose a lot of muscle, your body will start burning fewer calories than before (105Trusted Source, 106Trusted Source).

By lifting weights regularly, you’ll be able to prevent this loss in muscle mass"
100,Is it a good indicator of health?,"Most people get enough protein from diet alone. However, for those who don’t, taking a whey protein supplement is an effective way to boost protein intake."
101,What is storax?,"Mindful eating is a method used to increase awareness while eating.

It helps you make conscious food choices and develop awareness of your hunger and satiety cues. It then helps you eat healthy in response to those cues"
102,Dosage,"Dieting is one of those things that almost always fails in the long term. In fact, people who “diet” tend to gain more weight over time"
103,Some people also experience depression after losing weight,"Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that estimates a person’s body fat using their height and weight. A BMI of 18.5–24.9 is considered “normal” weight with a low risk of poor health, while anything above or below is linked to a higher risk of poor health."
104,Is it the same thing as an open relationship?,"Though BMI has been criticized for its oversimplification of health, most research supports its ability to estimate a person’s risk of chronic disease, particularly one’s risk of early death and metabolic syndrome."
105,What exactly is a throuple?,"Storax is a type of resin derived from the sap of Sweetgum trees. It has been used medicinally for centuries to treat various ailments, including bacterial and viral infections."
106,"So, what’re the basics?","There’s not enough data on storax to determine the appropriate dose or know the full extent of the risk of adverse reactions. However, it’s likely safe for most people to use in small quantities."
107,Where did the term originate?,"The truth is, any personal difficulties, relationship problems, or workplace challenges won’t automatically disappear once you lose weight. These concerns, and anything else troubling you, will probably stick around until you address them."
108,Do you have to use specific pronouns?,Here’s where it gets tricky: A throuple can be an open or closed relationship.
109,What Does It Mean to Be Gender Nonconforming?,"You may also hear a throuple referred to as a three-way relationship, triad, or closed triad."
110,Can anyone be gender nonconforming?,The term “nonbinary” tells you something about who a person is — not about what they might look like.
111,Types of bodyweight leg exercises,This quickly expanding set of vocabulary provides many people with the opportunity to locate and validate their personal and cultural experience of gender while communicating it to others.
112,Jump squat,"No matter your gender identity, it can be a good idea to introduce yourself to others with your name and pronouns. This may prompt others to share theirs."
113,Jump lunge,"Of course, because gender expectations differ from one society and culture to the next, what’s considered gender nonconforming in one culture might not be in another."
114,Step-up,You don’t have to be nonbinary or transgender in order to be gender nonconforming.
115,Benefits and drawbacks of bodyweight leg training,Squats and lunges are the primary movement patterns available for bodyweight leg training. Additional exercises can be added for more variety and comprehensive training.
116,Bok choy is very nutritious,Squats are a must-have exercise in your leg training program. There are progression options for increasing or decreasing the difficulty depending on your fitness level.
117,May promote heart health,Lunges are a key exercise to improve your strength and coordination for daily movement tasks. You have options for increasing the difficulty once you can perform standard lunges.
118,Potential side effects,Additional exercises that do not directly fit under the squat and lunge patterns can add variety to your warmup and workout options.
119,How to incorporate it into your diet,"Bodyweight leg exercises are a great way to begin developing functional strength and always a viable option for conditioning. Eventually, external resistance is needed for continued strength adaptations."
120,Kale,"Bok choy contains a wide variety of vitamins and minerals. It’s particularly high in vitamins C and K. It also offers some fiber, an important nutrient for overall health."
121,Microgreens,"Bok choy is rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that may offer benefits for thyroid function and heart and bone health. They may even have anticancer properties."
122,Collard Greens,"One case study suggests that eating bok choy raw in very large amounts may interfere with thyroid function, but this is probably not a concern with typical serving sizes. If you take blood thinning medication, you may want to watch your intake."
123,Spinach,"You can consume bok choy raw, roasted, or cooked on the stovetop in a soup, stir-fry, or fried rice dish. You can incorporate bok choy into your diet in Asian dishes and many other ways."
124,Cabbage,"Kale is rich in minerals, antioxidants and vitamins, particularly vitamins A, C and K. To reap the most benefits, it’s best eaten raw, as cooking reduces the nutritional profile of the vegetable."
125,Beet Greens,"Microgreens are immature greens, which have been popular since the 1980s. They’re flavorful and packed with nutrients like vitamins C, E and K. What’s more, they can be grown all year."
126,Watercress,"Collard greens have thick leaves and are bitter in taste. They’re one of the best sources of vitamin K, may reduce blood clots and promote healthy bones."
127,Romaine Lettuce,"Spinach is a popular leafy green vegetable that can be used in a variety of ways. It’s a great source of folate, which may prevent neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, during pregnancy."
128,Swiss Chard,"Cabbage has thick leaves and comes in various colors. It has cancer-protective properties and can be turned into sauerkraut, which offers additional health benefits."
129,Arugula,"Beet greens are edible green leaves found on the tip of beets. They’re full of nutrients, including antioxidants that may support eye health."
130,Endive,"Watercress has been used in herbal medicine for centuries. A few test-tube studies suggest it may be beneficial in cancer treatment, but no human studies have confirmed these effects."
131,Bok Choy,"Romaine lettuce is a popular lettuce found in many salads. It’s rich in vitamins A and K, and a study in rats suggests it may improve blood lipid levels."
132,Turnip Greens,"Swiss chard is rich in color and often incorporated into Mediterranean cooking. It contains the flavonoid syringic acid, which may be beneficial for reducing blood sugar levels. However, human-based research on its effectiveness is lacking."
133,How is corned beef made?,"Arugula is a leafy green vegetable that goes by several different names, including rocket and rucola. It’s rich in vitamins and naturally occurring nitrates, which may help reduce blood pressure and improve blood flow."
134,Nutritional content,"Endive is a lesser-known leafy green vegetable that is curly and crisp in texture. It contains several nutrients, including the antioxidant kaempferol, which may reduce cancer cell growth."
135,Health effects,"Bok choy is popular in China and often used in soups and stir-fries. It contains the mineral selenium, which benefits your brain health, immunity, cancer protection and thyroid health."
136,Recommendations,"Turnip greens are the leaves of the turnip plant and are considered a cruciferous vegetable. Studies have found that they may decrease stress in your body and reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer and inflammation."
137,What is Processed Meat?,Corned beef is made by brining brisket in a salt and spice solution to make it more tender and flavorful. It’s the traditional meat for a St. Patrick’s Day dinner.
138,Eating Processed Meat is Associated with an Unhealthy Lifestyle,Corned beef is flavorful meat tenderized and flavored by brining it in a salt and spice solution. It’s high in protein but high in fat and sodium.
139,Processed Meat is Linked with Chronic Disease,"Corned beef adds some important nutrients to your diet, but it’s still processed red meat, linked with an increased risk of health problems like heart disease and cancer."
140,"Nitrite, N-Nitroso Compounds and Nitrosamines","The WHO classifies corned beef and other processed meats as potential carcinogens. Eating it regularly may increase your risk of developing colorectal cancer. Thus, it’s best to eat it infrequently."
141,Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs),"All meat that has been smoked, salted, cured, dried or canned is considered processed. This includes sausages, hot dogs, salami, ham and cured bacon."
142,Heterocyclic Amines (HCAs),People who are not health-conscious tend to eat more processed meat. This may partly explain some of the associations found in studies investigating processed meat consumption and disease.
143,Sodium Chloride,"Eating high amounts of processed meat over a long period may increase the risk of many chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer."
144,Red Meat Is Very Nutritious,Processed meat that is fried or grilled may contain relatively high levels of nitrosamines. Studies suggest that these compounds may increase the risk of cancer in the stomach and bowel.
145,"Heart Disease, Diabetes and Death",Smoked meat products may contain high amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). These compounds have been shown to cause cancer in animals.
146,Does Red Meat Increase Your Risk of Cancer?,"Some processed meat products may contain heterocyclic amines (HCAs), carcinogenic compounds also found in well-done meat and fish."
147,Correlation Does Not Equal Causation,"Processed meat products contain large amounts of salt, which may contribute to some health problems."
148,A Look at Some Randomized Controlled Trials,"Red meat is very nutritious, especially if it comes from animals that have been naturally fed and raised. It’s a great source of protein, iron, B12, zinc, creatine and various other nutrients."
149,Red Meat Optimization 101,"Some observational studies show a link between meat intake, diabetes, heart disease and death. Other studies suggest this only applies to processed meat, not unprocessed red meat."
150,Eating Only Muscle Meats Can Create an Imbalance,"Several observational studies show that red meat eaters are at a greater risk of cancer, but larger reviews looking at the evidence as a whole show that the effect is weak and inconsistent."
151,Dangers of High-Heat Cooking,"Observational studies cannot be used to determine cause and effect. There are many confounders in such studies, and higher-quality studies sometimes end up showing the exact opposite effect."
152,Red Meat Is Very High in Iron,Several randomized controlled trials indicate that the intake of unprocessed red meat does not have negative health effects. It may even have benefits.
153,What are nitrates and nitrites?,"To prevent the formation of harmful substances when cooking meat, choose gentler cooking methods and avoid burning your meat."
154,Where nitrates and nitrites are found,Including organ meat in your diet in place of muscle meat may limit your intake of methionine. Limiting methionine in the diet may improve health and even affect longevity.
155,How nitrates affect blood pressure and heart health,"Cooking meat over high heat can form unhealthy compounds like heterocyclic amines, advanced glycation end products and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, all of which have been linked to an increased risk of disease."
156,Can nitrates fuel physical performance?,"Red meat is rich in iron. This is rarely a concern for healthy people, but it can be a problem for those who develop dangerously high blood levels of iron."
157,Risks of nitrates and nitrites,"Nitrates and nitrites are compounds consisting of nitrogen and oxygen atoms. Nitrates can turn into nitrites, which can then form either nitric oxide (good) or nitrosamines (bad)."
158,How to minimize nitrosamine exposure,"Nitrates are present in small amounts in processed meats and in larger amounts in healthy foods like vegetables. They also occur in drinking water, and the human body produces nitrates, too."
159,What Is Salt?,"In the body, nitrites can turn into nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule that causes blood vessels to dilate and reduces blood pressure."
160,How Does Salt Affect Heart Health?,"Studies suggest that dietary nitrates and nitrites can enhance physical performance, especially during high intensity endurance exercise."
161,Low Salt Intake Can Be Harmful,"When nitrites and amino acids are present, carcinogenic compounds called nitrosamines can form during cooking with high heat."
162,High Salt Intake is Linked to Stomach Cancer,You can reduce your risk of nitrosamine exposure by carefully selecting processed meat products that are low in additives that contain nitrates.
163,Which Foods Are High in Salt/Sodium?,"Salt is mainly composed of two minerals, sodium and chloride, which have various functions in the body. It is found naturally in most foods, and is widely used to improve flavor."
164,Fat-soluble vitamin functions,"Limiting salt intake does result in a slight reduction in blood pressure. However, there is no strong evidence linking reduced intake to a lower risk of heart attacks, strokes or death."
165,Special considerations,"A low-salt diet has been linked to higher LDL and triglyceride levels, and increased insulin resistance. It may increase the risk of death from heart disease, heart failure and type 2 diabetes."
166,Dietary sources of vitamins,Several observational studies have linked high salt intake with an increased risk of stomach cancer. This may be caused by several factors.
167,When to supplement,"Foods that are high in salt include processed foods, such as salted snacks and instant soups. Less obvious foods, such as bread and cottage cheese, may also contain a lot."
